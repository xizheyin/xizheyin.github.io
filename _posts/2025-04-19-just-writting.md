这是我的第一篇博客，想分享一下最近在学业和工作上的一些思考与感悟。

## 做出违背XX的决定——将科研放在第二位

"一个博士生怎么能不全力做科研？" 这个问题曾经困扰着我。

我还记得博士入学的时候，有人告诉我，博士生需要把科研放到第一位。这句话深深刻在我的脑海里，成为我前两年学术生涯的指导方针。
我全身心投入到科研中，日夜不停地阅读论文、设计实验、撰写报告。我相信只要足够努力，就一定能取得突破性的成果。

然而，随着时间推移，我渐渐感到一种空洞和疲惫。即使发表了A类论文，我也未从中获得预期的满足感。
每当深夜独自在实验室，我总会思考：我的研究真的在解决实际问题吗？我是否只是在学术圈内自我循环？

转折点出现在一次学术会议上。一位来自工业界的演讲者坦言："学术界的许多研究成果无法在实际环境中应用，
因为它们缺乏与实践的有机结合。"这句话如当头一棒，让我开始重新审视自己的道路。

我逐渐明白，如果在做的事情特别难受时，或许应该停下来反思。科研并不是什么不可触碰的神圣领域，
思维应当灵活，需要及时调整方向。过去一段时间，我常感觉自己的研究缺少了某种关键元素——它们似乎总是差那么一点意思。

回顾这两年的科研经验，我意识到当探索一个新领域时，不能急于求成。
真正的进步需要深入核心内容，厚积薄发，而非追求短期利益。表面的浅尝辄止无法带来真正的突破。

## 寻找平衡：为什么这个决定是正确的

将科研放在第二位对博士生而言，听起来几乎是异端。但这个决定的正确性逐渐在我的实践中得到证实：

参与开源项目让我接触到了前沿工程实践，这些是纯学术研究中难以获得的。例如，通过Rust编译器的贡献，我深入理解了类型系统的实际实现，这反过来启发了我的研究思路。
同时，理论研究常常基于理想假设，而开源社区的工作帮助我验证这些理论在实际环境中的适用性。曾经我对某个算法优化的研究，正是在实现过程中发现了原有假设的缺陷。
从用户和开发者的角度思考问题，而非纯粹的理论探索，让我的研究方向更加贴近实际需求。现在，我的研究问题多来自实际开发中遇到的挑战，而非学术文献的延续。
单一的学术压力常导致倦怠。多元化的活动帮助我保持热情和创造力。那些曾经困扰我的学术瓶颈，往往在参与开源项目后不经意间得到突破。
传统学术影响力主要限于引用率，而开源贡献能直接影响全球开发者。我的一个小小改进可能会帮助成千上万使用Rust的程序员，这种即时反馈带来的成就感无可比拟。

## 我的Rust社区之旅

2024年5月，是我认识观的转折点。我意识到不能继续按照传统轨迹在"科研"的外围打转。恰逢OSPP(开源之夏)项目开放申请，我鼓起勇气提交了申请。尽管由于经验不足未能入选，但这个过程让我结识了导师 Trevor Gross。

Trevor的热情与认真回复深深打动了我。在我信心不足时，他总是给予鼓励。他常常在美国时间凌晨两三点仍在社区审核代码，我在询问他为什么如此有热情时，他告诉我："The dedication is awesome!"

Rust社区的体验非常美好。这里永远有比你更懂的人，氛围开放且友善。起初，作为新人的我不敢提问，因此走了不少弯路。但Trevor告诉我：

> "You shouldn't ever worry about asking questions! There's always somebody else who has been wondering the same thing and will be happy to read the response you get."

于是我开始尝试提问，结果发现社区成员总是乐于解答并分享知识。我依然记得第一次提出一个编译器问题时的忐忑，以及收到高级维护者详细解答的惊喜。这种开放式学习模式，与学术界常见的封闭和竞争形成鲜明对比。

在短短几个月里，我已经贡献了30多个PR。从最初的文档修复，到现在能够修改编译器错误诊断信息，每一步都是成长。
虽然这些修改还没涉及复杂的新特性，但我相信这也是为Rust的发展贡献了一份力量。
这些代码将会发布到下一代Rust版本中，想到这点就令人兴奋不已。我希望能在开源项目中不断深入，逐渐掌握更核心的技术。

这种参与感和成就感，是纯学术研究难以提供的。每当看到自己的PR被合并，或收到用户因我的修复而表达的感谢，我都感受到自己工作的直接价值。

## 科研与开源的共生关系

最初，我担心开源活动会分散我的研究精力。但出乎意料的是，两者形成了相互促进的良性循环：

通过深入Rust编译器代码，我对编程语言设计有了更加实际的理解，这些成为我研究的独特视角。
学术训练赋予我的系统性思考方法，帮助我在修复bugs时能够追溯到问题的根源，而不仅是表面现象。
学术研究常需多年才能验证理论的实用性，而开源社区提供了即时反馈机制。
立足于学术与工程的交叉点，我发现了许多现有研究忽略的问题空间。

我正在尝试将我在Rust社区的经验融入到我的博士研究中，探索软件供应链安全的新方向。这种交叉研究不仅有学术价值，更有直接的实用性。

## 平衡的艺术

这种转变并非完全放弃科研，而是寻找一种更健康、更可持续的平衡。我现在的时间分配大约是：50%用于开源项目，40%用于相关学术研究，10%用于阅读和思考。

这样的安排让我能够在开源项目中保持持续参与，将实践经验转化为有深度的学术贡献，同时，保持对新知识和思想的开放性。

我常思考：像Rust这样拥有上百万行代码的复杂项目是如何管理的？贡献者们又是如何驾驭这样的庞然大物？
通过参与社区，我正在一步步找到答案。这些答案不仅帮助我成为更好的开源贡献者，也启发我思考如何改进学术协作模式。

## 结语

这段开源之旅让我明白，有时候打破常规思维，跳出舒适区，反而能找到更适合自己的成长路径。无论是科研还是开源贡献，最重要的是找到真正热爱的事，并为之付出持续的努力。

对任何正在读博的同学，我想说的是：不要被传统观念束缚，找到自己真正热爱并能发光发热的领域，哪怕这意味着暂时放慢论文发表的速度。长远来看，这种真实的热情和实践经验，将成为你最独特的竞争力。

学术的意义不仅在于发现新知识，更在于将知识转化为实际价值。当理论与实践相结合，我们才能真正推动领域的进步。而这，正是我选择这条不寻常道路的根本原因。

This is my first blog post, where I'd like to share some recent thoughts and insights about my academic and professional journey.

## Making an Unconventional Decision — Putting Research Second

"How can a PhD student not prioritize research?" This question troubled me for a long time.

I remember when I started my PhD program, someone told me that doctoral students should put research above everything else. This statement was deeply ingrained in my mind and guided my academic journey for the first two years. I devoted myself entirely to research, reading papers, designing experiments, and writing reports day and night. I believed that with enough effort, I would eventually achieve breakthrough results.

However, as time went by, I gradually felt a sense of emptiness and fatigue. Even after publishing A-tier papers, I didn't get the expected sense of fulfillment. During those late nights alone in the lab, I kept wondering: Is my research actually solving real-world problems? Am I just circulating within the academic bubble?

The turning point came during an academic conference. A speaker from industry stated frankly: "Many research outcomes from academia cannot be applied in real-world environments because they lack organic integration with practice." This statement hit me like a hammer, causing me to reevaluate my path.

I gradually realized that if something feels consistently uncomfortable, perhaps it's time to pause and reflect. Research isn't some untouchable sacred domain; thinking should be flexible, and direction should be adjusted when necessary. For some time, I felt that my research was missing a critical element—it always seemed to be lacking something essential.

Looking back at my two years of research experience, I realized that when exploring a new field, one shouldn't rush for results. Real progress requires delving into core content, accumulating knowledge steadily rather than pursuing short-term benefits. Superficial approaches never lead to genuine breakthroughs.

## Finding Balance: Why This Decision Was Right

For a PhD student, putting research second sounds almost heretical. But the correctness of this decision has been progressively confirmed in my practice:

Participating in open-source projects exposed me to cutting-edge engineering practices that are difficult to acquire in purely academic research. For example, through my contributions to the Rust compiler, I gained a deeper understanding of actual type system implementation, which in turn inspired my research approaches.

At the same time, theoretical research is often based on ideal assumptions, while work in the open-source community helps verify these theories in practical environments. Once, during my research on algorithm optimization, it was during implementation that I discovered flaws in the original assumptions.

Looking at problems from the perspective of users and developers, rather than purely theoretical exploration, has made my research direction more relevant to actual needs. Now, my research questions often come from challenges encountered in actual development rather than just extensions of academic literature.

Single-minded academic pressure often leads to burnout. Diversifying activities helps maintain enthusiasm and creativity. Academic bottlenecks that once troubled me often get unexpectedly resolved after engaging in open-source projects.

Traditional academic influence is primarily limited to citation rates, while open-source contributions can directly impact developers worldwide. A small improvement I make might help thousands of Rust programmers—this immediate feedback provides an incomparable sense of achievement.

## My Journey in the Rust Community

May 2024 was a turning point in my perspective. I realized I couldn't continue circling around the periphery of "research" along traditional trajectories. Coincidentally, when the OSPP (Open Source Promotion Plan) opened for applications, I gathered my courage to submit one. Although I wasn't selected due to my limited experience, this process introduced me to mentor Trevor Gross.

Trevor's enthusiastic and thoughtful responses deeply moved me. When I lacked confidence, he always provided encouragement. He often reviewed code in the community at 2-3 AM his time in the US. When I asked him why he was so passionate, he told me: "The dedication is awesome!"

The experience in the Rust community has been wonderful. There are always people who know more than you do, and the atmosphere is open and friendly. Initially, as a newcomer, I was afraid to ask questions, which led me down some unnecessary detours. But Trevor told me:

> "You shouldn't ever worry about asking questions! There's always somebody else who has been wondering the same thing and will be happy to read the response you get."

So I started asking questions and found that community members were always eager to answer and share knowledge. I still remember my nervousness when I first raised a compiler issue, and the delightful surprise of receiving a detailed answer from a senior maintainer. This open learning model stands in stark contrast to the closed and competitive environment often found in academia.

In just a few months, I've contributed over 30 PRs. From initial documentation fixes to now being able to modify compiler error diagnostics, each step has been growth. Although these changes haven't yet involved complex new features, I believe they still contribute to Rust's development. These code changes will be released in the next generation of Rust, which is incredibly exciting. I hope to go deeper into the open-source project and gradually master more core technologies.

This sense of participation and achievement is something that pure academic research struggles to provide. Whenever I see my PR merged or receive thanks from users for my fixes, I feel the direct value of my work.

## The Symbiotic Relationship Between Research and Open Source

Initially, I worried that open-source activities would disperse my research energy. But surprisingly, the two formed a mutually beneficial cycle:

By delving into Rust compiler code, I gained a more practical understanding of programming language design, which became a unique perspective in my research. The systematic thinking method given to me by academic training helps me trace bugs to their root causes, not just surface phenomena. Academic research often needs years to validate theoretical usefulness, while the open-source community provides immediate feedback mechanisms. Standing at the intersection of academia and engineering, I've discovered many problem spaces overlooked by existing research.

I'm trying to integrate my experiences from the Rust community into my doctoral research, exploring new directions in software supply chain security. This cross-disciplinary research not only has academic value but also direct practical applications.

## The Art of Balance

This shift doesn't mean completely abandoning research but finding a healthier, more sustainable balance. My current time allocation is approximately: 50% for open-source projects, 40% for related academic research, and 10% for reading and thinking.

This arrangement allows me to maintain continuous participation in open-source projects, transform practical experience into deep academic contributions, and stay open to new knowledge and ideas.

I often think about how complex projects like Rust, with millions of lines of code, are managed, and how contributors navigate such behemoths. Through community participation, I'm gradually finding answers. These insights not only help me become a better open-source contributor but also inspire me to think about improving academic collaboration models.

## Conclusion

This open-source journey has taught me that sometimes breaking conventional thinking and stepping out of your comfort zone can lead you to a path more suited to your growth. Whether in research or open-source contributions, the most important thing is to find what you truly love and dedicate continuous effort to it.

To any doctoral students reading this, I'd like to say: Don't be bound by traditional notions. Find what you truly love and where you can shine, even if it means temporarily slowing down your paper publication rate. In the long run, this genuine passion and practical experience will become your most unique competitive advantage.

The significance of academia isn't just in discovering new knowledge but in transforming knowledge into practical value. When theory and practice are combined, we can truly advance the field. And this is precisely why I chose this unconventional path.
